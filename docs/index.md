## Background

Between school events, birthday invites, doctor appointments, and daily chaos, staying organized is harder than it looks — especially when you're the default scheduler at home. Opening Google Calendar and typing in each event one-by-one can be tedious.

Kalenda aims to:

- Make scheduling feel conversational, not technical
- Let you **create events by sending a text, screenshot, or voice note**
- Simplify calendar management for busy parents, professionals, and caretakers
- Reduce mental load from remembering dates, times, and deadlines

  Forward a photo of a flyer or invitation — Kalenda will extract event info automatically

- **Voice Support**  
  Don’t feel like typing? Send a voice note — Kalenda transcribes and schedules it for you
